# AWS Partitions

Floci serves every AWS partition, not only the commercial one. A partition is the second
segment of every ARN (`arn:aws-cn:...`), the DNS suffix of every endpoint
(`amazonaws.com.cn`), and the set of services and regions AWS publishes there. Floci reads
all of it from AWS's own partition metadata (botocore's `partitions.json` and
`endpoints.json`, vendored as `aws/partitions.json` and refreshed with `make aws-data-sync`).

| Partition | DNS suffix | Regions | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aws` | `amazonaws.com` | 34 published (17 opt-in) | `us-east-1` |
| `aws-cn` | `amazonaws.com.cn` | `cn-north-1`, `cn-northwest-1` | `cn-north-1` |
| `aws-us-gov` | `amazonaws.com` | `us-gov-east-1`, `us-gov-west-1` | `us-gov-west-1` |
| `aws-iso` | `c2s.ic.gov` | `us-iso-east-1`, `us-iso-west-1` | `us-iso-east-1` |
| `aws-iso-b` | `sc2s.sgov.gov` | `us-isob-east-1`, `us-isob-west-1` | `us-isob-east-1` |
| `aws-iso-e` | `cloud.adc-e.uk` | `eu-isoe-west-1` | `eu-isoe-west-1` |
| `aws-iso-f` | `csp.hci.ic.gov` | `us-isof-east-1`, `us-isof-south-1` | `us-isof-south-1` |
| `aws-eusc` | `amazonaws.eu` | `eusc-de-east-1` | `eusc-de-east-1` |

## Which partition a deployment serves

The deployment's partition is derived from `FLOCI_DEFAULT_REGION`: `cn-north-1` means
`aws-cn`, `us-gov-west-1` means `aws-us-gov`, and so on. Set `FLOCI_PARTITIONS_ID`
(`floci.partitions.id`) to name it explicitly; startup refuses a value that is not a
published partition or that contradicts a recognised default region, and logs one line
naming the partition it settled on:

```
Partition: aws-cn (default-region cn-north-1, dns suffix amazonaws.com.cn)
```

A default region the vendored data does not know only warns. AWS launches regions faster
than the data is refreshed, and botocore's region-shape rules (`cn-*`, `us-gov-*`, ...)
still place it; anything else falls back to `aws`, which is what the AWS SDKs do too.

### Running a China, GovCloud, ISO or EUSC deployment

Start Floci with a default region in the partition, then point clients at it with a region in
the same partition and an endpoint override:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:4566:4566 \
  -e FLOCI_DEFAULT_REGION=cn-north-1 \
  floci/floci:latest

AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=cn-north-1 bin/awslocal sts get-caller-identity
# "Arn": "arn:aws-cn:iam::000000000000:root"
```

With the AWS CLI directly, pass `--region cn-north-1 --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566`; with
an SDK, set the region and the endpoint override on the client. The override replaces the
partition's real host (`amazonaws.com.cn` here) for transport only: the SDK still signs for the
region you gave it, and that signing region is what places each request in its partition (see
below). If clients reach Floci on another host or port than `http://localhost:4566`, set
`FLOCI_BASE_URL` to match, or URLs Floci returns, such as SQS queue URLs and pre-signed URLs,
keep pointing at the default. `FLOCI_HOSTNAME` is enough when only the host differs: it replaces
the host and keeps the port.

## Which partition a request belongs to

Each request's partition comes from the region in its SigV4 credential scope, exactly as
LocalStack and moto do it. A client signing `cn-north-1` is a China client even when Floci
was started with `us-east-1`, so one process can serve several partitions at once. Requests
without a credential, and background work (pollers, schedulers, startup hooks), use the
deployment's partition.

The scope region of a global service is its *signing* region, not a place to put regional
resources: China IAM always signs `cn-north-1` even from Ningxia, GovCloud IAM signs
`us-gov-west-1`. Floci uses it to pick the partition and nothing else. The
`<partition>-global` pseudo-regions the SDKs accept (`aws-global`, `aws-cn-global`, ...)
resolve to their partition as well; `aws-eusc` publishes none. AWS never signs with one (the SDKs
map each to a real signing region), so a scope that names one is served as the partition's
implicit global region: a request signed `aws-cn-global` is a `cn-northwest-1` request, and no
ARN or storage namespace carries the pseudo-region.

A scope region that no partition publishes or admits by its region pattern, such as
`polygondwanaland-west-1`, is refused with a 400: an S3-signed request gets S3's
`AuthorizationHeaderMalformed` ("the region '...' is wrong"), every other service gets
`InvalidSignatureException`. On AWS such a request never resolves a host; moto
(`MOTO_ALLOW_NONEXISTENT_REGION`) and LocalStack (`ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_REGIONS`) refuse it too.
The pattern rule is the AWS SDKs' own, so a region AWS launches after the vendored data was
refreshed (`eu-south-9`, say) is still served; it is looser than S3's `LocationConstraint` enum,
which stays published-only. Set `FLOCI_PARTITIONS_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REGIONS=true`
(`floci.partitions.allow-unknown-regions`) to serve any label with its own namespace, as Floci
did before. Such a label belongs to the deployment's partition. ARNs minted through Floci's
shared region resolver use that partition too; services that build their ARNs directly still fall
back to `aws` for a label no partition publishes.

## What changes per partition

- **ARNs**: regional resources carry the partition of their region (`arn:aws-cn:sqs:cn-north-1:...`);
  regionless resources (IAM, S3, STS, CloudFront, Route 53, Organizations) carry the request's
  partition.
- **DescribeRegions**: the request's partition's regions, with the partition's endpoints.
  As on AWS, a commercial deployment lists the 17 regions that need no opt-in by default and
  all 34 with `AllRegions=true`, where opt-in regions report `not-opted-in`.
- **Hostnames**: AWS-shaped hosts in responses (an HTTP API's `ApiEndpoint`, a bucket's
  `RegionalDomainName` and `WebsiteURL`, Cognito and EKS OIDC issuers, EC2 public DNS names)
  use the DNS suffix of their region's partition, so a `cn-north-1` API answers
  `<id>.execute-api.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn`. `DualStackDomainName` is only returned where
  S3 publishes a dual-stack endpoint.
- **Hostname recognition**: every published region id and DNS suffix, in every partition, is
  recognised in an S3 virtual-host, execute-api, ECR image or CloudFront origin hostname.
- **S3 CreateBucket**: as on AWS, the `us-east-1` endpoint takes any `LocationConstraint` but
  its own, and every other regional endpoint requires a constraint naming exactly its region
  (`IllegalLocationConstraintException` otherwise). A China or GovCloud client must send the
  constraint, which the AWS SDKs do; `GetBucketLocation` still answers an empty constraint only
  for `us-east-1`, in every partition.
- **Hosted zones and console URLs**: load balancer and S3 website hosted zone ids come from a
  per-region table (`aws/region-facts.json`, generated from the Terraform provider and the CDK,
  which transcribe the AWS General Reference); Network load balancers have their own zone,
  distinct from the Application/Classic one. The CloudFront hosted zone is published for `aws`
  and `aws-cn`; the SAML sign-on URL for five partitions. The ISO and EUSC regions have no load
  balancer hosted zones, and only the two ISO-F regions have an S3 website zone; where a table has
  no row the field is omitted rather than guessed. An `EDGE` API Gateway custom domain is refused
  outside the commercial partition (`BadRequestException`): GovCloud and ISO have no CloudFront,
  and China has no edge-optimized API Gateway
  ([China API Gateway](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/api-gateway.html)).
- **VPC endpoint service names**: interface endpoints (as `DescribeVpcEndpointServices` lists them)
  are `com.amazonaws.<region>.<service>` everywhere, except the (region, service) pairs the CDK
  lists for China, ISO and EUSC, which reverse the DNS suffix (`cn.com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.lambda`).
  GovCloud keeps `com.amazonaws`. Gateway endpoints and their AWS-managed prefix lists (S3,
  DynamoDB) are `com.amazonaws.<region>.<service>` in every partition. S3 offers both kinds: where
  the two names agree it is one service carrying both types, and in China it is listed twice, the
  gateway `com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.s3` and the interface `cn.com.amazonaws.cn-north-1.s3`.
- **Lambda runtime images** pull from ECR Public (`public.ecr.aws`), which exists only in the
  commercial partition; point `FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_ECR_BASE_URI` at a mirror elsewhere.
- **WAF `CLOUDFRONT` scope**: available only where CloudFront exists (`aws`, `aws-cn`), and its
  resources live in the partition's implicit global region (`cn-northwest-1` in China).

## What does not change

- **Service principals** are `<service>.amazonaws.com` in every partition; that is the rule
  the AWS CDK applies today, and everything Floci emits (generated trust policies, CloudTrail's
  `eventSource`, service-linked role paths) uses it. The older per-partition forms the CDK
  retired (`elasticmapreduce.amazonaws.com.cn`, `logs.<region>.amazonaws.com.cn`,
  `config.c2s.ic.gov`) are still accepted wherever Floci matches a principal against a policy,
  such as a role's trust policy, so a policy written in either form works; matching stays exact
  and case-sensitive. `CreateServiceLinkedRole` given a legacy form creates the same role as the
  universal one: its name, path and trust policy all use `<service>.amazonaws.com`.
- **XML namespaces** and the S3 canned-ACL group URIs (`http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/...`)
  are identifiers, not hosts.
- **AWS managed policy ARNs** keep the literal `aws` account slot: `arn:aws-cn:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess`.
  The catalog Floci bundles is the commercial one; every other partition's is derived from it on
  first use, with the partition in every ARN (what AWS's own SAM translator does) and the
  partition's DNS suffix in the region-bearing `kms:ViaService` hosts (`s3.*.amazonaws.com.cn`).
  Service principals and service-linked role paths are the same in every partition and are left
  alone. Whether AWS's China or GovCloud documents differ in content beyond that is an open
  question below.

## Partition-absent services

AWS publishes which services exist in each partition (CloudFront is not in GovCloud, Lightsail
is not in China). On AWS a request for an absent service never reaches an API: the SDK
fails to resolve the host and reports an `UnknownHostException`. Floci serves every enabled
service in every partition by default.

Set `FLOCI_PARTITIONS_STRICT=true` (`floci.partitions.strict`) to mirror AWS instead. A request
whose SigV4 signing name the request's partition does not publish is refused with a 404
`UnknownOperationException` whose message names the service and the partition; Floci cannot
fail DNS, so this is the same shape the unknown-service guard uses. The check reads the vendored
service list, matching the signing name directly or through the endpoint prefixes it covers
(`ecr` signs for `api.ecr`, `bedrock` for `bedrock-runtime`), so a China ECR client is served
while a GovCloud CloudFront client is refused. Only a service the data lists in some other
partition is refused: `endpoints.json` omits the newer services that ship an endpoint ruleset
alone (FIS, MWAA, S3 Tables), and those are served everywhere.

A partition also offers a service when that service's endpoint ruleset names the partition in a
branch with its own endpoint, even where `endpoints.json` leaves it out: IAM, Route 53, Budgets and
Cost Explorer in `aws-eusc` (`iam.eusc-de-east-1.amazonaws.eu`), IAM and Cost Explorer in
`aws-iso-e`. The vendored data records these under `servicesFromRulesets`. The `execute-api`
signing name is never refused: API Gateway's invoke endpoints and its WebSocket management API
(`apigatewaymanagementapi`) sign with it as well as Connect Participant, and `endpoints.json` lists
the API Gateway side nowhere, so the data cannot say where the name is served.

STS is regionalized everywhere and its global host `sts.amazonaws.com` exists only in `aws`, so
IAM's `GetAccountSummary` reports `GlobalEndpointTokenVersion` only there.

An IAM resource (user, group, role, policy, instance profile, OIDC provider) is created in the
request's partition and keeps it: a rename signed for another partition does not move it. On AWS
an account belongs to one partition, but one Floci process serves them all, so anything derived
from a stored resource follows that resource. A role's sessions (`assumed-role`) and the OIDC
provider its web-identity trust policy names take the stored role's partition, whichever partition
the request's `RoleArn` names, so `AssumeRole` and a later `GetCallerIdentity` agree whatever region
each call is signed for. The credential report is kept per partition, so its root row always
names the caller's. ARNs with nothing stored
behind them, the `root` fallback of `GetCallerIdentity` and `federated-user`, take the request's
partition.

## How it is tested

- **The partition rules themselves** (partition and region lookup, ARN minting, hostnames,
  service principals, managed-policy rewriting, STS) have unit tests over all eight partitions.
- **Through the emulator**, IAM ARNs and Step Functions run in all eight partitions, and a smoke
  test creates one resource in every non-commercial partition for SNS, Kinesis, Firehose, API
  Gateway V2, ELBv2, Glue, IoT, ACM, CodeBuild, Batch and EFS and checks its ARN or host. A new
  service that mints ARNs or hosts needs a case there or a recorded exemption. Most other
  partition-dependent behaviour (S3 bucket rules, EC2 regions and DNS names, hosted zones, VPC
  endpoint names, Lambda layers, CloudFormation pseudo-parameters, strict mode) is tested in one or
  two partitions, nearly always China.
- **End to end**, the nightly Partition Compatibility workflow runs the Java SDK compatibility
  suite against a Floci deployed with `FLOCI_DEFAULT_REGION=cn-north-1`, with the SDK clients
  signing for `cn-north-1`, so the SDK's own China partition handling has to round-trip. Its list
  of known failures, `.github/ci/compat-partition-allowlist-cn-north-1.txt`, is empty, so any
  failure fails the run. No other partition, and no other compatibility suite (the Python, Go,
  Node and AWS CLI suites, CDK, Terraform, OpenTofu), runs outside the commercial partition.

## Known gaps

- **One process serving several partitions shares global state.** S3 bucket names are one
  namespace, and `ListBuckets` lists buckets created from every partition; IAM, Organizations,
  Route 53, CloudFront and the IAM Identity Center instance keep one set of resources per account,
  whichever partition a request is signed for. AWS keeps them per partition. A deployment that serves one partition is
  unaffected.
- **AWS managed policies** are the commercial catalog in every partition, with their ARNs and
  regional hosts rewritten; AWS publishes no per-partition list.
- **Client tooling** that computes partition values itself (CDK bootstrap and
  `AWS::Partition`, Terraform's `aws_partition`, SAM) is not tested outside the commercial
  partition, and neither is any partition but China end to end.

## Open questions

These values have no published source Floci can cite, so it does not guess them; they keep
the commercial value or Floci's own base host until sourced:

- the China CloudFront distribution domain suffix (only the API host is published);
- the console device-authorization client ids (`arn:aws:signin:::devtools/...`) outside the
  commercial partition;
- the STS web-identity audience outside the commercial partition;
- the EKS Pod Identity token audience (`pods.eks.amazonaws.com`) outside the commercial partition;
- the Lambda function-URL host outside the commercial partition;
- whether AWS managed policy documents differ in content in China or GovCloud;
- the API Gateway regional hosted zone per region;
- S3 `LocationConstraint` enum values and Route 53 hosted zones for the ISO and EUSC regions;
- the SAML sign-on URL in `aws-iso-e`, `aws-iso-f` and `aws-eusc`, where assertions keep being
  checked against the commercial `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`;
- the exact error AWS WAF returns for the `CLOUDFRONT` scope in a partition without CloudFront
  (GovCloud, the ISO partitions): Floci refuses it with `WAFInvalidParameterException` and its own
  message.
