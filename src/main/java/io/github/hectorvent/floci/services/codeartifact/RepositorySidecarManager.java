 * Common contract for a CodeArtifact sidecar backing one package format: get one repository ready
 * to serve that format, and release whatever backing storage it holds once the repository is
 * deleted. Implementations are discovered via CDI by {@link CodeArtifactSidecarRegistry}, so
 * adding the next format's sidecar (npm, pypi, nuget) needs no change to
 * {@link CodeArtifactService} or any other format's manager.
 *
 * <p>Named around the effect ("release this repository's backing storage"), not the mechanism,
 * because the mechanism is expected to differ per sidecar. {@code ReposiliteSidecarClient}, the
 * first implementation, deletes files and removes one entry from a settings list shared by every
 * maven repository in a single Reposilite instance; a future format whose sidecar runs one
 * container per repository would instead stop and remove that container. Both are legitimate
 * implementations of the same contract even though neither necessarily "stops a container" the
 * way the other might.
